## ⚠️ Remaining Optimization Opportunities

### **High Priority** (High Impact, Medium Risk)

#### **1. Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP)** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:** Priority inversion
- High-priority tasks can block on locks held by low-priority tasks
- Example: Input handler waits for lock held by background task

**LMAX/Real-Time Learning:**
- **LMAX:** No explicit lock contention (single-writer principle avoids locks)
- **Real-Time Theory:** Priority Inheritance Protocol prevents priority inversion delays

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium-High
- Requires tracking lock holders (futex operations)
- Need to boost lock holder's priority temporarily
- Must handle nested locks and inheritance chains

**Expected Impact:**
- **Latency Reduction:** ~500ns-2µs per lock contention scenario
- **Deadline Guarantee:** Prevents cascading deadline misses

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending** - Requires lock tracking infrastructure

---

#### **2. Deadline Miss Detection & Auto-Recovery** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:** No feedback mechanism for deadline misses

**Real-Time Learning:**
- **Adaptive Scheduling:** Self-tuning schedulers react to deadline misses
- **Deadline Guarantees:** Tracking misses enables deterministic guarantees

**Implementation:**
```c
// Track when tasks miss deadlines
if (completion_time > deadline) {
    tctx->deadline_misses++;
    if (tctx->deadline_misses > threshold) {
        // Auto-boost priority
        tctx->boost_shift = MIN(tctx->boost_shift + 1, 7);
    }
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Latency Reduction:** ~100-200ns (through auto-tuning)
- **Self-Healing:** Prevents cascading deadline misses

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending** - Requires completion tracking

---

### **Medium Priority** (Medium Impact, Low-Medium Risk)

#### **3. Per-CPU Statistics (Eliminate False Sharing)** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:** Statistics counters shared across CPUs cause cache line bouncing

**LMAX Learning:**
- **Cache-Line Awareness:** False sharing kills performance
- **Per-CPU Structures:** Each CPU gets its own cache line

**Implementation:**
```c
struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY);
    __uint(max_entries, 1);
    __type(key, u32);
    __type(value, u64);
} compositor_detect_page_flips_percpu SEC(".maps");
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Latency Savings:** ~10-30ns per stat update
- **Cache Performance:** Eliminates false sharing overhead

**Trade-off:** More complex userspace aggregation (only needed for stats display)

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending** - Low priority, only affects stats overhead

---

#### **4. Rate Monotonic Scheduling Integration** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:** Static priority doesn't adapt to actual task periods

**Real-Time Learning:**
- **RMS Principle:** Tasks with shorter periods get higher priority
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Priority should reflect actual task behavior

**Implementation:**
- Detect task periods (from wakeup frequency)
- Adjust boost_shift based on detected period
- Input: <5ms period → boost 7
- GPU: <16ms period → boost 6
- Compositor: <4ms period → boost 5

**Expected Impact:**
- **Latency Reduction:** ~50-100ns (better priority alignment)
- **Adaptability:** Handles variable frame rates (VRS, DLSS)

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending** - Medium complexity, requires period detection

---

#### **5. Per-CPU Ring Buffers (Single Writer)** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:** Multiple BPF CPUs may write to same ring buffer (contention)

**LMAX Learning:**
- **Single Writer Principle:** Each producer gets its own buffer
- **Wait-Free Guarantee:** No contention = no atomic operations needed

**Implementation:**
```c
struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY);
    __uint(max_entries, RING_BUFFER_SIZE);
} input_ring_buffer_percpu SEC(".maps");
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Latency Savings:** ~20-50ns per ring buffer write
- **Contention Elimination:** Perfect single-writer guarantee

**Trade-off:** More complex userspace aggregation (must read from all CPUs)

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending** - Medium complexity, only benefits high-contention scenarios

---

### **Low Priority** (Lower Impact, Higher Risk/Complexity)

#### **6. NUMA-Aware CPU Selection** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:** CPU selection doesn't consider NUMA topology

**LMAX Learning:**
- **NUMA Awareness:** Local memory access is ~50-100ns faster
- **Memory Locality:** Critical for memory-intensive threads (GPU/compositor)

**Expected Impact:**
- **Latency Savings:** ~50-100ns per memory access
- **Cache Performance:** Better cache locality on NUMA systems

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending** - Complex, only benefits multi-socket systems

---

#### **7. Memory Prefetching** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:** Cache misses in hot paths

**LMAX Learning:**
- **Prefetch Next:** Prefetch predictable memory accesses
- **Temporal Locality:** Prefetch with high temporal locality hints

**Expected Impact:**
- **Latency Savings:** ~5-20ns if cache miss avoided
- **Risk:** Potential cache pollution if misused

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending** - Low impact, requires profiling to identify hotspots

---

#### **8. Pipeline-Aware Scheduling** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem:** Pipeline stages scheduled independently

**Gaming-Specific Learning:**
- **Pipeline Stages:** Input → Game Logic → GPU → Compositor → Display
- **Stage Completion:** Next stage should be boosted when current completes

**Expected Impact:**
- **Latency Reduction:** ~100-300ns per stage transition
- **Frame Pacing:** Better pipeline throughput

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending** - Complex, requires stage completion detection
